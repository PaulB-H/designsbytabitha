  This was my first experience using PHP, which was a bit of a detour
  for me because it was not something covered in the bootcamp. I
  enjoyed using many of the great built in features such as sessions
  and password_hash.

<p class="projectDesc">
  The logo on the homepage was made by taking a commissioned image and
  running it through a vector converter turning it into an SVG. The
  masks page connects to the user system, both of which use the SQL
  DB. I used a lightweight popup library to help build the shopping
  cart functionality.
</p>
<p class="projectDesc">
  User passwords are hashed and salted before entry into the DB, and I
  used PHP-Session to build the login system. There is also an
  administrator order-management section, providing the ability to
  filter and search orders, update status, and even keep track of
  items made per order.
