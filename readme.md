My first project using PHP, I learned as I built.<br>
<br>
I enjoyed how easy PHP sessions were to use, and got some expirence using SQL Prepared Statements.<br>
<br>
I also created a login / user system, and a shopping cart / order management system. No payment is setup through the site yet, it is just to make it easier to manage orders for the client so far.<br>
<br>
The project was not originally uploaded to Github, which caused me to get a bit lazy with the structure. I plan on cleaning this up with future commits.
